    <h2>Seth</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Seth. I am a computer science major currently attending Brigham Young University - Idaho.
    I love to hike, kyack, run, lift, game and spend time with friends and family. I am not married, however I am the 
    youngest of 10 siblings who have 9 children between them. Safe to say family gatherings are not quiet</p>
    <p>I recently returned from serving a full time mission in the Utah Salt Lake City West mission, Spanish speaking. 
    Up top is a picture of me on my mission. It was an experience that changed my life. I am so glad that I served, it 
    changed my life forever.</p>
    <p>I love BYU-I. I love the atmosphere of love and acceptence that surrounds the campus. I love the lessons of the 
    Savior I recieve every day, not just from my religion courses. I love Rexburg. Everything about it is perfect for me.</p>
    <p> Feel free to reach out to me at any time, and I am excited to learn.</p>
